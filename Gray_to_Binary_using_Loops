; GRAY TO BINARY USING LOOPS
MOV AL, 40H
MOV BL, AL
           
MOV CL, 7           
BACK:
SHR BL,1
XOR AL, BL
DEC CL
JNZ BACK
HLT

;THIS CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED BY THE FOLLOWING CODE
; GRAY TO BINARY USING LOOP INSTRUCTION
MOV AL, 40H
MOV BL, AL
           
MOV CL, 7           
BACK:
SHR BL,1
XOR AL, BL
LOOP BACK ; OBSERVE WHICH OF THE  FLAGS BE AFFECTED WHEN YOU USE LOOP INSTRUCTION
HLT
